         "<br>" +"<h3 align='center' id='bodyHistory'>   RentACar is much more than a rental car business. We are a company that prides itself on dedication to customers changing needs by offering a wide variety of vehicles. We boast a rich history of significant first steps, ambitious ideas and innovation that has formed our company into the reputable brand it is today. In 2009, ambitious pioneers of auto renting: Martin Romero, Coral Romero, Ibrahima Haidara and Miriam Lopez began what is now known as The RentACar Corporation. Starting with a mere 12 Model-Ts and set up shop just south of Germany's loop. Together they swiftly turned the small RentACar company into a well-known brand. In fact, by 2015, RentACar was generating annual revenues of about $1 million.</h3>" +
